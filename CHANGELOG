CHANGELOG
*********

3.2.0
==========
- Replaced the ``molecules`` argument with ``ligands`` in ``generate_lomap_network()``. Argument name ``molecules`` will be deprecated.

2.3.0
=====
- Added shift option to MCS and cli (-s or --shift), this defaults to True.  In combination with threed/-3 this option
  controls if the two structures are shifted on top of each other (using only translation and no rotation) before
  geometric mismatch is judged.  This was always used as default until now.
  In cases where bad symmetric options are being chosen, using shift=False might resolve issues.
  Fixes #26

2.2.0
=====
- Added use_common_core option to DBMolecules and -C --common-core option to CLI.
  This is on by default and speeds up network creation by 10-50x (PR #25)
- Fixed DBMolecules iteration in Python 3 (PR #18)
	
2.1.0
=====
- Added "element_change" keyword to MCS class. This toggles if elemental changes are allowed
  within a mapping.  Defaults to True (this was previous behaviour)
- Added "-L" switch to command line usage to toggle element changes

2.0.0
=====
- Breaking changes: replaced usage of argparse.Namespace as input to class inits (e.g. MCS) in favour of dicts.
- Renamed various dunderscore variables to single underscore
- Fixed bug in explicit hydrogen atom mappings
- Rewrote tests in pytest, using fixtures to iterate over cases
- Added regression tests for MCS class


1.0.0
=====

- added versioning
- support for python 3.5 and networkx2
- improved visualisation of output networks
- better enforcement of PEP8 style python
- no longer support for python 2.7

0.0.x
=====

Internal Alpha version
----------------------
- Basic functionality of preparing a Perturbation map for alchemical free energy calculations
